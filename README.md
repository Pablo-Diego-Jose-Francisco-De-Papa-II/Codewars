# Codewars Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) challenges.  
I use it as a personal archive to track my progress, practice coding, and improve problem-solving skills in **Java**.

## Repository Structure
- All solutions are written in **Java**.
- The source code is located inside the `src/` directory.
- Within `src/`, solutions are grouped by **kata difficulty** (e.g., `8kyu`, `7kyu`, etc.).
- Each difficulty folder contains the corresponding challenge solutions.

## Notes
- These are **my** personal solutions and may not always represent the most optimized or best practices.
- Feel free to explore and compare different approaches.
